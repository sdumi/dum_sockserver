Test Sock Server
================

Configuring and Building
========================

Currently no configuration is needed, as there is no installation script.
To build the process:
  g++ -o sockserver sockserver.cc


Running and connecting to server
================================

To run the server invoke the executable name and give a port number:
  ./sockserver 112233

To connect to server, simply telnet to host (ie: localhost) on the port specified at server startup:
  telnet localhost 112233
